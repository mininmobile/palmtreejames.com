		<h1>Content Creation</h1>
		<p>I have been making videos since March of 2020 on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Over the past few years, I've accumulated a following of over 750,000 people, mostly of which are on TikTok. I have also streamed frequently and built an audience of almost 30,000 people on Twitch, and in 2021 signed as a partner. I am experienced in social media algorithms and marketing as I have been contracted by well-known companies like Epic Games for promotion, and continuously market my own Palm Tree RL brand to millions every month. Go to <b>analytics</b> for specifics numbers or go to <b>skills</b> for elaborate description of my skillset.</p>
