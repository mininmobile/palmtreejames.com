		<h1>Content Creation</h1>
		<p>I have been making videos since March of 2020 on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Over the past few years, I've accumulated a following of over 750,000 people, mostly of which are on TikTok. I have also streamed frequently and built an audience of almost 30,000 people on Twitch, and in 2021 signed as a partner. I am experienced with social media algorithms and marketing as I have been contracted by well-known companies like Epic Games for promotion, and continuously market my own Palm Tree RL brand to millions every month. I recently joined a Talent Agency with experience working with big brands like Adidas, and Warner Bros, and will be participating in campaigns with them shortly. Go down to analytics for specifics numbers or go to <a href="/skills.html">skills</a> for elaborate description of my skillset.</p>
