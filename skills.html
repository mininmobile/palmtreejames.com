		<h1>Skills</h1>
		<h2>Programming</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<p><b>Python</b> &ndash; I was introduced to Python in 2019 through an AP/college course and recently earned a certification in Entry Level Python from the Python Institute.</p>
			<p><b>Java</b> &ndash; in 2021 I was introduced to Java through my second AP/college course and have developed intermediate -level skills in programming with Java.</p>
			<p><b>Source Code management</b> &ndash; I recently learned basics of source control and collaboration on GitHub and Git and am still learning/practicing to become more familiar and experienced with source code management skills.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Content Creation</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<p><b>Entertainment</b> &ndash; I have made over 1000 videos for social media and learned how to not only appeal to an audience but also to keep their attention since watch time is so heavily implemented into social media recommendation algorithms.</p>

		</div>

		<h2>Software</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<p><b>AutoCAD</b> &ndash; Through my Engineering Magnet Program I learned all the basics of AutoCAD and applied it to sketches for hypothetical engineering scenarios.</p>
			<p><b>Autodesk Inventor</b> &ndash; In 2021 my Engineering magnet program covered 3d modeling in inventor and I have learned all the basics of replicating/creating 3d models of objects and tools in the real world.</p>
			<p><b>Python</b> &ndash; I was introduced to Python in 2019 through an AP/college course and recently earned a certification in Entry Level Python from the Python Institute.</p>
			<p><b>MATLAB</b> &ndash; In my Engineering Magnet Program I learned basics of MATLAB and applied it to programming projects for physics-related calculations.</p>
			<p><b>Java</b> &ndash; in 2021 I was introduced to Java through my second AP/college course and have developed intermediate level skills in programming with Java.</p>
