		<h1>Education</h1>
		<p>I am currently a Senior at Eastern Technical Magnet High School, a top 1% high school in America,
			ranked #3 in Maryland, and #224 nationally according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/maryland/districts/baltimore-county-public-schools/eastern-technical-high-school-9049">US News and World Report</a>. I have had rigorous
			courses each year consisting of mostly AP and GT classes, and maintained a GPA of 4.45. I have
			dedicated a lot of my educational experience to computer science passing two AP exams for Comp Sci,
			and going out of my way to earn a certification in entry level Python by the python institution. My next
			step in education is to go into computer science at college and continuing courses and exams for more
			programming certifications.
