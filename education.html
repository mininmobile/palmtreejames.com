		<h1>Education</h1>
		<p>I am currently a Senior partaking in a 4-year Engineering magnet program at Eastern Technical Magnet High School - rated a top 1% high school in America. Eastern Tech is ranked #3 in Maryland, and #224 nationally according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/maryland/districts/baltimore-county-public-schools/eastern-technical-high-school-9049">US News and World Report</a>. I have had rigorous courses each year consisting of mostly AP and GT classes and maintained a GPA of 4.5. I have dedicated a lot of my educational experience to computer science passing two AP/college exams for Comp Sci, and going out of my way to earn a certification in entry level Python by the python institution. I am currently dual enrolled in community college to take computer science classes that my high school does not offer. I have also developed fluency in Spanish as I have taken Spanish classes for 5 years and passed the AP/college exam for Spanish Language. My next step in education is to go into computer science at college and continue courses and exams for more programming certifications.
